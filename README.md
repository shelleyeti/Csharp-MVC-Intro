# Instructions
This is an instructor-guided exercise to learn about MVCs

## Student List Razor Template

1. Right click on the `Index` method in your `StudentsController`.
1. Choose `Add View..`.
1. In the window that appears, provide a name of `Index`, template is `List`, and then choose the `Student` model.
1. Click `Add` and wait for the Razor template to be generated.

## Viewing the List of Students

Now you start the project, and visit [http://localhost:5000/students](http://localhost:5000/students) in your browser to see the HTML representation of student you have in your database.

## Adding the Other Views

The next step is to create the `Details` view, the `Edit` view, and the `Delete` view. Use the scaffolding for _MVC View_ to create the Razor templates for each one. Don't attempt to build the create view until you get to the next chapter about View Models.
