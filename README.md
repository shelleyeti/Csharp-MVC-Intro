# Student Exercise Web Application

## Instructions
## Displaying a List of Cohorts, Instructors, Students, and Exercises

Your first task for this exercise is to start a new Visual Studio Web Application (MVC) project named `StudentExercisesMVC`. Then make a controller and corresponding Razor templates in order to manage the cohorts for your database.

Use scaffolding to...

1. Create a `Controller` in your controllers directory.
1. Create a `Views > Cohorts/Instructors/Students/Exercises` directory and use the scaffolding to the create the `Index`, `Details`, `Create`, `Edit`, and `Delete` views.
1. In your controller, use ADO.NET to execute SQL statements for all of those actions.

Modify your student edit form to display all exercises in a multi-select element. The user should be able to select one, or more exercises, in that element. When the user submits the form, then the `StudentExercises` table in your database should have a new entry added for each of the exercises that were selected in the form.
